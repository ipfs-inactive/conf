- [**SCHEDULE**](https://developersmeetingsberlin2018.sched.com/)

The IPFS Dev Meetings will be a small, 3-day working summit for active IPFS maintainers, contributors and the people who are most actively building software on IPFS. It will be followed by 1-day libp2p Dev Meeting specifically focused on libp2p. 

As a distributed project with contributors spread all over the world, we do most of our work and decision making remotely. In fact, even some of the core maintainers have never met in person. We embrace the distributed nature of this ecosystem, but we also appreciate the power of spending time in the same physical space with like-minded people. As we poise for explosive growth in this ecosystem, and Working Groups play an increasingly prominent role in driving the ecosystem, these meetings will be an opportunity to establish shared context and working relationships, becoming better leaders of the communities that grow around them.

Our priority for the IPFS and libp2p Dev Meetings is to get all of the maintainers, most of the active contributors, and a strong sampling of people who have committed real time and effort to building software on IPFS and libp2p. Participants should be prepared to address key unresolved technical and community challenges, to co-create a sense of shared membership, ownership, and responsibility, and to leave the Dev Meetings with more responsibilities than they had when they arrived. Working sessions will focus on things like establishing OKRs, updating Roadmaps, etc.

Participants will be selected by application. You can apply by filling out the [IPFS Dev Meeting Application Form](https://goo.gl/forms/sVRjrW1CA61FTwl12) and/or the [libp2p Dev Meeting Application Form](https://goo.gl/forms/8YpFQ7D00s5gC3hw2) To be eligible for selection you must either be an active contributor on GitHub or you must have your work reflected in the IPFS User Registry. Participants will be chosen based their directly-relevant responsibilities, the contributions they've made to the ecosystem, and the impact of their work. We might also invite a small number of guests to provide perspective, inspiration, and guidance from outside our immediate projects.
